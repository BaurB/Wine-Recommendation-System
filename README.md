# Wine-Recommendation-System

This project is focused on building a recommendation system and analyse the current state of wine market: Identify big wine producing countries/regions, preference towards wine types, variation of wine types and other features. Two recommendation systems are proposed and both of them are based on the content-based filtering system: 1) Wine rating based and 2) Wine description based. Use of collaborative filtering is planned by collecting/scraping additional high-quality data from different web sources. Finally, a simple ML algorithms were used to classify the wine type and predicting wine rating based on the features collected from the vivino.com website. Overall, the project is split to 6 folders. Each folder has 1 notebook and generated csv files.

1) Wine Data Collection from Vivino.com
2) Exploratory Data Analysis on Collected Data
3) Constructing User Rating Dataset for Recommendation System
4) Building a Recommendation System
5) Description Based Recommendation System
