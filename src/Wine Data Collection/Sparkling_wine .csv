0,Governor's Cuvée Stanford Brut Champagne,Weibel Family,N.V.,3.0,5.99,California,United States,Chardonnay,2.9239216,3.7035296000000004,,,"The elegance of sparkling wine suits Northern California's wine region. While California isn't exactly famous for its bubbles, there are some fabulous bottles on offer.

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

For pairing with Californian sparkling wine you should look towards seafood. A nice charred squid or some scallops would go wonderfully, and you could even work something a little spicier in there."

In Northern Italy's Piedmont region, the town of Asti and a few surrounding provinces produce Italy's most popular sparkling wine, Moscato d'Asti. These wines are famous all over the world for their delicate sweetness and carbonation, which makes them immensely approachable and endlessly enjoyable.

True Moscato d'Asti should not be confused with the slightly inferior Asti Spumante.

This high quality bubbly offers outstanding bang for the buck, and is an excellent substitute for those seeking high quality sparkling wines without spending a fortune.

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

For pairing with Californian sparkling wine you should look towards seafood. A nice charred squid or some scallops would go wonderfully, and you could even work something a little spicier in there."

This high quality bubbly offers outstanding bang for the buck, and is an excellent substitute for those seeking high quality sparkling wines without spending a fortune.

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

Champagne has long been the wine of choice to celebrate special occasions, and its reputation as a luxury beverage has been intact since the Romans established vineyards in Reims in the 5th century (that's a really long time ago).

Sparkling Champagne wasn't discovered until the 16th century, by accident, by the Benedictine Monks. Early vintages of Champagne were dubbed “the devil's wine” because the bottles tended to explode. Improvements to both bottle and cork developed over hundreds of years.

Champagne is made from a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Munier grapes, and most of it is produced as a non-vintage wine, meaning that it's a blend of several vintages. Generally speaking, non-vintage Champagne is fantastic, and tends to be less expensive than vintage Champagne—this is because a vintage year is only declared when growing conditions are especially favorable.

The convivial nature of Champagne is due in part to how it's made. Following primary fermentation and bottling, a secondary alcoholic fermentation is induced in the bottle, which is achieved by the addition of yeast and rock sugar. The bubbles we love so much are a natural byproduct of this magical secondary fermentation, in the form of carbon dioxide."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

The convivial nature of Champagne is due in part to how it's made.

In Northern Italy's Piedmont region, the town of Asti and a few surrounding provinces produce Italy's most popular sparkling wine, Moscato d'Asti. These wines are famous all over the world for their delicate sweetness and carbonation, which makes them immensely approachable and endlessly enjoyable.

True Moscato d'Asti should not be confused with the slightly inferior Asti Spumante.

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

Sparkling Champagne wasn't discovered until the 16th century, by accident, by the Benedictine Monks. Early vintages of Champagne were dubbed “the devil's wine” because the bottles tended to explode. Improvements to both bottle and cork developed over hundreds of years.

The convivial nature of Champagne is due in part to how it's made. Following primary fermentation and bottling, a secondary alcoholic fermentation is induced in the bottle, which is achieved by the addition of yeast and rock sugar.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

For pairing with Californian sparkling wine you should look towards seafood. A nice charred squid or some scallops would go wonderfully, and you could even work something a little spicier in there."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

This high quality bubbly offers outstanding bang for the buck, and is an excellent substitute for those seeking high quality sparkling wines without spending a fortune.

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

In Northern Italy's Piedmont region, the town of Asti and a few surrounding provinces produce Italy's most popular sparkling wine, Moscato d'Asti.

True Moscato d'Asti should not be confused with the slightly inferior Asti Spumante.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County.

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

This high quality bubbly offers outstanding bang for the buck, and is an excellent substitute for those seeking high quality sparkling wines without spending a fortune.

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

In Northern Italy's Piedmont region, the town of Asti and a few surrounding provinces produce Italy's most popular sparkling wine, Moscato d'Asti. These wines are famous all over the world for their delicate sweetness and carbonation, which makes them immensely approachable and endlessly enjoyable.

True Moscato d'Asti should not be confused with the slightly inferior Asti Spumante.

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

For pairing with Californian sparkling wine you should look towards seafood. A nice charred squid or some scallops would go wonderfully, and you could even work something a little spicier in there."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

This high quality bubbly offers outstanding bang for the buck, and is an excellent substitute for those seeking high quality sparkling wines without spending a fortune.

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

True Moscato d'Asti should not be confused with the slightly inferior Asti Spumante.

This high quality bubbly offers outstanding bang for the buck, and is an excellent substitute for those seeking high quality sparkling wines without spending a fortune.

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

This high quality bubbly offers outstanding bang for the buck, and is an excellent substitute for those seeking high quality sparkling wines without spending a fortune.

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

True Moscato d'Asti should not be confused with the slightly inferior Asti Spumante.

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

For pairing with Californian sparkling wine you should look towards seafood. A nice charred squid or some scallops would go wonderfully, and you could even work something a little spicier in there."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

While California isn't exactly famous for its bubbles, there are some fabulous bottles on offer.

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

For pairing with Californian sparkling wine you should look towards seafood. A nice charred squid or some scallops would go wonderfully, and you could even work something a little spicier in there."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

This lovely wine will always be lower in alcohol and sweeter than the more famous Champagne, but those reasons are why it is so graceful.

In Northern Italy's Piedmont region, the town of Asti and a few surrounding provinces produce Italy's most popular sparkling wine, Moscato d'Asti. These wines are famous all over the world for their delicate sweetness and carbonation, which makes them immensely approachable and endlessly enjoyable.

True Moscato d'Asti should not be confused with the slightly inferior Asti Spumante. Moscato d'Asti will always be about 5.5% alcohol and lightly fizzy and can be the perfect light wine for dessert or even breakfast.

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

For pairing with Californian sparkling wine you should look towards seafood. A nice charred squid or some scallops would go wonderfully, and you could even work something a little spicier in there."

Sparkling Champagne wasn't discovered until the 16th century, by accident, by the Benedictine Monks. Early vintages of Champagne were dubbed “the devil's wine” because the bottles tended to explode. Improvements to both bottle and cork developed over hundreds of years.

Generally speaking, non-vintage Champagne is fantastic, and tends to be less expensive than vintage Champagne—this is because a vintage year is only declared when growing conditions are especially favorable.

The convivial nature of Champagne is due in part to how it's made.

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

While California isn't exactly famous for its bubbles, there are some fabulous bottles on offer.

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

Sparkling Champagne wasn't discovered until the 16th century, by accident, by the Benedictine Monks. Early vintages of Champagne were dubbed “the devil's wine” because the bottles tended to explode. Improvements to both bottle and cork developed over hundreds of years.

Champagne is made from a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Munier grapes, and most of it is produced as a non-vintage wine, meaning that it's a blend of several vintages. Generally speaking, non-vintage Champagne is fantastic, and tends to be less expensive than vintage Champagne—this is because a vintage year is only declared when growing conditions are especially favorable.

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

Expect flavors of green apple, ripe pear, even lemon and lime citrus, as well as riper peach and tropical fruit, right along with an array of white floral notes. Those produced in the traditional method will show off flavors of toasted brioche, imparted by the yeast used to make the wine.

True Moscato d'Asti should not be confused with the slightly inferior Asti Spumante.

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

True Moscato d'Asti should not be confused with the slightly inferior Asti Spumante. Moscato d'Asti will always be about 5.5% alcohol and lightly fizzy and can be the perfect light wine for dessert or even breakfast.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

For pairing with Californian sparkling wine you should look towards seafood. A nice charred squid or some scallops would go wonderfully, and you could even work something a little spicier in there."

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

For pairing with Californian sparkling wine you should look towards seafood. A nice charred squid or some scallops would go wonderfully, and you could even work something a little spicier in there."

This high quality bubbly offers outstanding bang for the buck, and is an excellent substitute for those seeking high quality sparkling wines without spending a fortune.

Sparkling wine from Spain is produced almost exclusively in Catalonia. It is produced using the same method as in Champagne, but is distinguished to it due to geographic designation.

The primary grapes used to produce Cava are Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello, which produces a crisp, dry, effervescent and refreshing bubbly at a far more accessible price point than Champagne. Many are under $20 retail!

Cava may also contain Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Garnacha, Monastrell, and Trepat – many of which are used to produce rosé bubbly, often containing red fruit flavors such as strawberry and raspberry.

Green apple, pear and citrus are frequently noted in cava, although older vintages can produce more nuanced flavor profiles. The high acidity found in most caves makes them an easy pairing with a variety of foods, and it is also commonly consumed as an aperitif."

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

1344,Cartizze Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore Dry,Bisol,2014,4.0,44.99,Conegliano-Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Italy,Glera (Prosecco),3.8525462,2.1569834,,,"A beautiful, somewhat less popular, and often less expensive comparison to Champagne, Prosecco is a deliciously dry sparkling wine with crisp acidity, low sugar, with plenty of fruit and character.

Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine.

Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label.

This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry; lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Traditionally served as an aperitif, Prosecco can also be enjoyed with salty cured meats, caviar, or even your favorite dessert. Prosecco is not generally considered a wine to collect."

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

These wines are known to be crisp, dry and extremely mousse-y. With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.

Sparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

For pairing with Californian sparkling wine you should look towards seafood. A nice charred squid or some scallops would go wonderfully, and you could even work something a little spicier in there."

They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).

Most Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.

Some of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.

For pairing with Californian sparkling wine you should look towards seafood. A nice charred squid or some scallops would go wonderfully, and you could even work something a little spicier in there."

Champagne is made from a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Munier grapes, and most of it is produced as a non-vintage wine, meaning that it's a blend of several vintages. Generally speaking, non-vintage Champagne is fantastic, and tends to be less expensive than vintage Champagne—this is because a vintage year is only declared when growing conditions are especially favorable.

The convivial nature of Champagne is due in part to how it's made. Following primary fermentation and bottling, a secondary alcoholic fermentation is induced in the bottle, which is achieved by the addition of yeast and rock sugar. The bubbles we love so much are a natural byproduct of this magical secondary fermentation, in the form of carbon dioxide."
