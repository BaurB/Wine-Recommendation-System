There is a lot of scope for versatility with this sweet, viscous wine, though you can expect to get hints of tropical fruit, nectarine, melon and pineapple from a solid Riesling.

The grape originated in the Rhine region of Germany, and the best of them are said to grow along the banks of the Mosel River on the beautiful steep, south facing hills.

There are six categories of Riesling which indicate the ripeness of the grapes. Kabinett is considered “off-dry” and is a typically ripe grape. Spätlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.

It's a favorite in the food and beverage industry because of its willingness to play with a wide variety of foods, particular spicy dishes. The current Asian fusion boom is thought to have had a tremendous effect on Riesling's popularity."

To know Northern Italian wines is to know the influences of the wines of the countries that border Italy.

Old World wines tend to be far less about fruit-forward  flavors, and more about the effect that the climate, soil, and adjacently growing flora (terroir) have on the grapes during their growth.

The most widely recognizable varietal is Pinot Grigio which is very rustic, medium-bodied, with medium to high acidity. Chardonnay seems to grow anywhere grapes can grow; although Italian varieties are not normally coveted quality.

Gewürztraminer usually makes us think of Germany, but it's also thriving in Northern Italy. The warmer climate imparts a little less sugar and little more acidity than its German cousin.

Then there is Moscato. From the northwest Piedmont region, this wine is sweet and very popular in North America, and comes in both still and sparkling varieties.

Whatever your choice, taking a tour of Italian white wines is an enjoyable experience that you will be thankful you took."

Fiano and Greco are the two big white varietals in Campania and Basilicata, while Sicily has become known for their Bianco d'Alcamo, a dry wine made from the Marsala grape.

Southern Italy's reputation has taken a beating in recent years as they have become known for producing bulk wine that they can't sell, and the reputation seems to endure despite some lovely wine coming from Sicily, Campania and Basilicata.

Fiano tends to be a wonderfully creamy white wine with lots of green apple skin and pear. Greco, arguably Campania's flagship white grape, is a lot crisper, and typically has an abundance of minerality, lemon notes and pear.

The white wine of Southern Italy pairs extremely well with the creamy regional cuisine, as well as with some freshly caught fish or shellfish."

On the palate, these wines are crisp with bright, and refreshing citrus and tropical fruit notes along with great minerality. Some boast a lingering, spicy finish.

There are three types of Torrontés found in South America: Torrontés Riojano, a highly aromatic wine;  Torrontés Sanjuanino, which is less fragrant than the Riojano, and the Torrontés Mendocino, the least expressive of the three. 

Torrontés thrives in high-altitude, cool, dry climates. The Riojano shows the most depth in Argentina's Cafayate region of Salta, situated on the edge of the Andes Mountains in the northwestern part of the country.

Wine critics warn that when Torrontés is grown in warmer climates or not produced properly, it can be over-alcoholic and bitter."

The much-lauded white wines of New Zealand tend to be slightly sweeter than those from Bordeaux and the Loire Valley, and are hugely influenced by the growing conditions of the country.

The grape originates from Bordeaux, where it is also known as Pouilly-Fumé, Sancerre, and Graves, and is one of the world's most widely planted grapes.

Marlborough is the most revered wine-producing region in the small country, accounting for 62% of all wine produced in New Zealand.

The New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc scene started popping in 1970s, with the high quality Sauvignon Blancs coming out of Marlborough illustrating the great potential for grape growing in New Zealand.

Sauvignon Blanc tends to be fermented in stainless steel vats, which results in a clean, crisp flavor, and will not show any of that butteriness that is often prevalent in well-oaked Chardonnay for instance.

When it comes to pairing, think white meat, shellfish, and try to accentuate the herbaceous qualities of the wine with ingredients like parsley and cilantro."

88,Vin Jaune Côtes du Jura,Badoz,2011,3.6,39.98,Côtes du Jura,France,Savagnin,,,,,"Vin jaune from the Jura region of France, is best known for oxidized nutty and toasty flavors and aromas, similar to a dry Fino Sherry. These high-acid wines also offer up notes of curry, spice, citrus and mineral.

To create vin jaune, wine from Savagnin grapes—an ancient variety native to northeastern France and southwestern Germany—spends six years nearly untouched under a layer of flor (naturally occurring yeast) inside a cask (a process similar to sherry production, but Vin Jaune is not fortified).

Vin jaune is made in four Jura appellations: Arbois, Château-Chalon, Côtes du Jura and L'Étoile. The best examples of vin jaune come from Château-Chalon, where the Savagnin is late-harvested so it achieves more flavor and ripeness. It is also the only wine that's allowed to be made in that region.

True to its name, 'vin jaune', which translates to 'yellow wine', can show in the glass as bright yellow or golden in color."

You will not find many famous grapes grown in this region, but you will find some great values.

Italian white wines can be very frustrating and confusing. They do not make many wines from grapes that most people are familiar with. However, some of the local grapes that are used can make wines that are elegant, refreshing, and fun.

A lot of the really great white wines from Central Italy are going to be simple and light. They do not have a ton of strong fruit flavors, but can often produce subtly beautiful flavors of tart stone fruits, white flowers, and often almonds.

Keep your eyes open for the underrated wines of Verdicchio di Matelica or Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi."

The region also produces off-dry versions generally labeled as Vendange Tardive (VT or late harvest) and Sélection de Grains Nobles (SGN meaning that the wines have been affected by Noble Rot).

Alsace is a wine growing region in Northeast France that borders Germany. Because Alsace is proximal to Germany, cradled in the shadow of the Vosges Mountain range and just east of the Rhine River, it shares many common grape varieties.

Riesling is the darling of Alsace, and a favorite of wine lovers worldwide, for it is both versatile and budget friendly.

Alsatian Rieslings are terroir-expressive and said to have a fresh and vibrant profile, often with an appealing minerality shining through. This is due, in part to the dry, sunny climate and the soil types found in the region—a mix of granite, limestone, schist and sandstone are typical.

The true beauty of Alsatian Riesling, both the dry and off-dry version, is that they are extraordinarily food friendly. Try dry Rieslings with fish tacos, sushi, smoked fish, asparagus and, one of our favorites, goat cheese. Off-dry Rieslings have an affinity with Thai food, curries, shrimp cocktail and, another one of our favorites, apple pie."

Fiano and Greco are the two big white varietals in Campania and Basilicata, while Sicily has become known for their Bianco d'Alcamo, a dry wine made from the Marsala grape.

Southern Italy's reputation has taken a beating in recent years as they have become known for producing bulk wine that they can't sell, and the reputation seems to endure despite some lovely wine coming from Sicily, Campania and Basilicata.

Fiano tends to be a wonderfully creamy white wine with lots of green apple skin and pear. Greco, arguably Campania's flagship white grape, is a lot crisper, and typically has an abundance of minerality, lemon notes and pear.

The white wine of Southern Italy pairs extremely well with the creamy regional cuisine, as well as with some freshly caught fish or shellfish."

Because Alsace is proximal to Germany, cradled in the shadow of the Vosges Mountain range and just east of the Rhine River, it shares many common grape varieties.

Gewürztraminer can trace its lineage to Alsace, and is the second most planted variety in the region.

Gewürztraminer is an aromatic grape, this is typically expressed as exotic fruits such as lychee, star fruit, passion fruit or mango. In addition to lush fruit notes, a host of other aromatics makes for a complex and heady elixir—orange peel, roses, honey, and baking spices are also common fragrances. A deep gold color, it tends to be full-bodied with fairly low acidity and sometimes has a lovely spritz (or slight effervescence).

As a rule, Alsatian Gewürztraminer is unoaked, and is produced in both a dry and off-dry style. Late Harvest Gewürz are made as well, generally labeled as Vendange Tardive (VT) and Sélection de Grains Nobles (or SGN meaning that the wines have been affected by Noble Rot).

Universally known as the wine to pair with spicy Asian cuisine, Gewürztraminer has a broader range of pairing potential. Both dry and off-dry Gewürztraminer will compliment roast duck, washed-rind cheeses like Epoisses, cream of potato soup, bratwurst, omelets with smoked salmon and pizza with figs and Praga ham. Pair off-dry Gewürztraminer with foie gras, apple tartin, or desserts featuring tropical fruit."

A tough, non-fussy grape, Barbera has been known to be flexible in its acclimation to different regions. It's typically a deep ruby color with low tannin and bracing, high acidity.



Barbera is the wine of the working people in the region that it grows. It's less “respected” than Nebbiolo, and is therefore shunted into slightly less-desirable locations, though it has legions of dedicated patrons.

Unlike many of the other red grapes in the Piedmont, Barbera has a relatively long hang time on the vine and that imparts a lot of rich, dense flavors to the wine.

Barbera d'Asti is the most famous DOCG (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita) in which the grape grows. This is a warm, hilly region in the Piedmont.

As Barbera is well known for its acidity you should try to pair it with some rich, fatty foods and dark meats."

These wines are typically high in acidity and great with food.

Sauvignon Blanc in California is usually a little fruitier than it is in France, and a little lighter in body and color than a typical Chardonnay.

Sauvignon Blanc might be the perfect wine for summertime and California makes some of the best. The wines are usually light, crisp, and brimming with gorgeous flavors of zesty lime, grapefruit, and melon. These fruit flavors are perfectly complemented with subtle herbal flavors. Some say that Sauvignon Blanc smells like freshly mown grass.

One of the best parts about Sauvignon Blanc is that it is relatively inexpensive. A lack of new oak and smaller demand, keeps its prices lower than Chardonnay. You can get great deals on these. Look for great Sauvignon Blancs from classic Napa Valley producers."

Fiano and Greco are the two big white varietals in Campania and Basilicata, while Sicily has become known for their Bianco d'Alcamo, a dry wine made from the Marsala grape.

Southern Italy's reputation has taken a beating in recent years as they have become known for producing bulk wine that they can't sell, and the reputation seems to endure despite some lovely wine coming from Sicily, Campania and Basilicata.

Fiano tends to be a wonderfully creamy white wine with lots of green apple skin and pear. Greco, arguably Campania's flagship white grape, is a lot crisper, and typically has an abundance of minerality, lemon notes and pear.

The white wine of Southern Italy pairs extremely well with the creamy regional cuisine, as well as with some freshly caught fish or shellfish."

The region also produces off-dry versions generally labeled as Vendange Tardive (VT or late harvest) and Sélection de Grains Nobles (SGN meaning that the wines have been affected by Noble Rot).

Alsace is a wine growing region in Northeast France that borders Germany. Because Alsace is proximal to Germany, cradled in the shadow of the Vosges Mountain range and just east of the Rhine River, it shares many common grape varieties.

Riesling is the darling of Alsace, and a favorite of wine lovers worldwide, for it is both versatile and budget friendly.

Alsatian Rieslings are terroir-expressive and said to have a fresh and vibrant profile, often with an appealing minerality shining through. This is due, in part to the dry, sunny climate and the soil types found in the region—a mix of granite, limestone, schist and sandstone are typical.

The true beauty of Alsatian Riesling, both the dry and off-dry version, is that they are extraordinarily food friendly. Try dry Rieslings with fish tacos, sushi, smoked fish, asparagus and, one of our favorites, goat cheese. Off-dry Rieslings have an affinity with Thai food, curries, shrimp cocktail and, another one of our favorites, apple pie."

One should do what they must to ensure that life is not spent without having experienced the complexity and sumptuousness of Alsatian Pinot Gris.

Historically Alsace has been in a tug-of war between France and Germany, but France won. What this means for the wine is that production methods and nuances of both countries make their way into the bottles this region produces.

The wines are full-bodied, with a flavorful bouquet of lime, meyer lemon, green apple, pear, and white peach. They exemplify the notions of ripeness, spice, and high acidity. Expect Alsatian Pinot Gris to be a little spendier than other varieties of this grape.

Be sure to serve this wine ice cold. This wine pairs very well with light fishes such as perch, and soul. It also tastes amazingly well with chicken, turkey, duck or pork. Cruciferous vegetables are well complimented by the acid in the wine as are well spiced greens."

Champagne has long been the wine of choice to celebrate special occasions, and its reputation as a luxury beverage has been intact since the Romans established vineyards in Reims in the 5th century (that's a really long time ago).

Sparkling Champagne wasn't discovered until the 16th century, by accident, by the Benedictine Monks. Early vintages of Champagne were dubbed “the devil's wine” because the bottles tended to explode. Improvements to both bottle and cork developed over hundreds of years.

Champagne is made from a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Munier grapes, and most of it is produced as a non-vintage wine, meaning that it's a blend of several vintages. Generally speaking, non-vintage Champagne is fantastic, and tends to be less expensive than vintage Champagne—this is because a vintage year is only declared when growing conditions are especially favorable.

The convivial nature of Champagne is due in part to how it's made. Following primary fermentation and bottling, a secondary alcoholic fermentation is induced in the bottle, which is achieved by the addition of yeast and rock sugar. The bubbles we love so much are a natural byproduct of this magical secondary fermentation, in the form of carbon dioxide."

These high-acid wines also offer up notes of curry, spice, citrus and mineral.

To create vin jaune, wine from Savagnin grapes—an ancient variety native to northeastern France and southwestern Germany—spends six years nearly untouched under a layer of flor (naturally occurring yeast) inside a cask (a process similar to sherry production, but Vin Jaune is not fortified).

Vin jaune is made in four Jura appellations: Arbois, Château-Chalon, Côtes du Jura and L'Étoile. The best examples of vin jaune come from Château-Chalon, where the Savagnin is late-harvested so it achieves more flavor and ripeness. It is also the only wine that's allowed to be made in that region.

True to its name, 'vin jaune', which translates to 'yellow wine', can show in the glass as bright yellow or golden in color."

There is a lot of scope for versatility with this sweet, viscous wine, though you can expect to get hints of tropical fruit, nectarine, melon and pineapple from a solid Riesling.

The grape originated in the Rhine region of Germany, and the best of them are said to grow along the banks of the Mosel River on the beautiful steep, south facing hills.

There are six categories of Riesling which indicate the ripeness of the grapes. Kabinett is considered “off-dry” and is a typically ripe grape. Spätlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.

It's a favorite in the food and beverage industry because of its willingness to play with a wide variety of foods, particular spicy dishes. The current Asian fusion boom is thought to have had a tremendous effect on Riesling's popularity."

The best sweet styles are made from grapes affected by noble rot, which become golden and honeyed. Dry styles possess a chalky minerality to them.

Spanning the Loire River as it flows out to the Atlantic Ocean, the region has diverse soils and climates, meaning Chenin Blanc comes in all different styles.

Because of the grape's inherent high acidity, Chenin Blanc's charm can be lost in cooler vintages, with the acid overpowering."

There is a lot of scope for versatility with this sweet, viscous wine, though you can expect to get hints of tropical fruit, nectarine, melon and pineapple from a solid Riesling.

The grape originated in the Rhine region of Germany, and the best of them are said to grow along the banks of the Mosel River on the beautiful steep, south facing hills.

There are six categories of Riesling which indicate the ripeness of the grapes. Kabinett is considered “off-dry” and is a typically ripe grape. Spätlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.

To create vin jaune, wine from Savagnin grapes—an ancient variety native to northeastern France and southwestern Germany—spends six years nearly untouched under a layer of flor (naturally occurring yeast) inside a cask (a process similar to sherry production, but Vin Jaune is not fortified).

Vin jaune is made in four Jura appellations: Arbois, Château-Chalon, Côtes du Jura and L'Étoile. The best examples of vin jaune come from Château-Chalon, where the Savagnin is late-harvested so it achieves more flavor and ripeness. It is also the only wine that's allowed to be made in that region.

True to its name, 'vin jaune', which translates to 'yellow wine', can show in the glass as bright yellow or golden in color."

These wines are typically high in acidity and great with food.

Sauvignon Blanc in California is usually a little fruitier than it is in France, and a little lighter in body and color than a typical Chardonnay.

Sauvignon Blanc might be the perfect wine for summertime and California makes some of the best. The wines are usually light, crisp, and brimming with gorgeous flavors of zesty lime, grapefruit, and melon. These fruit flavors are perfectly complemented with subtle herbal flavors. Some say that Sauvignon Blanc smells like freshly mown grass.

One of the best parts about Sauvignon Blanc is that it is relatively inexpensive. A lack of new oak and smaller demand, keeps its prices lower than Chardonnay. You can get great deals on these. Look for great Sauvignon Blancs from classic Napa Valley producers."

483,Gewürztraminer Sélection de Grains Nobles,Leon Beyer,1998,4.4,200.32,Alsace,France,Gewürztraminer,,,,,"Alsace is a wine growing region in Northeast France that borders Germany. Because Alsace is proximal to Germany, cradled in the shadow of the Vosges Mountain range and just east of the Rhine River, it shares many common grape varieties.

Gewürztraminer can trace its lineage to Alsace, and is the second most planted variety in the region.

Gewürztraminer is an aromatic grape, this is typically expressed as exotic fruits such as lychee, star fruit, passion fruit or mango. In addition to lush fruit notes, a host of other aromatics makes for a complex and heady elixir—orange peel, roses, honey, and baking spices are also common fragrances. A deep gold color, it tends to be full-bodied with fairly low acidity and sometimes has a lovely spritz (or slight effervescence).

As a rule, Alsatian Gewürztraminer is unoaked, and is produced in both a dry and off-dry style. Late Harvest Gewürz are made as well, generally labeled as Vendange Tardive (VT) and Sélection de Grains Nobles (or SGN meaning that the wines have been affected by Noble Rot).

Universally known as the wine to pair with spicy Asian cuisine, Gewürztraminer has a broader range of pairing potential. Both dry and off-dry Gewürztraminer will compliment roast duck, washed-rind cheeses like Epoisses, cream of potato soup, bratwurst, omelets with smoked salmon and pizza with figs and Praga ham. Pair off-dry Gewürztraminer with foie gras, apple tartin, or desserts featuring tropical fruit."

562,Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc,Duckhorn,2012,3.9,51.0,Knights Valley,United States,Sauvignon Blanc,,,,,"California is known primarily for its Cabernet and Chardonnay, but they are also producing some really lovely Sauvignon Blancs. These wines are typically high in acidity and great with food.

Sauvignon Blanc in California is usually a little fruitier than it is in France, and a little lighter in body and color than a typical Chardonnay.

Sauvignon Blanc might be the perfect wine for summertime and California makes some of the best. The wines are usually light, crisp, and brimming with gorgeous flavors of zesty lime, grapefruit, and melon. These fruit flavors are perfectly complemented with subtle herbal flavors. Some say that Sauvignon Blanc smells like freshly mown grass.

One of the best parts about Sauvignon Blanc is that it is relatively inexpensive. A lack of new oak and smaller demand, keeps its prices lower than Chardonnay. You can get great deals on these. Look for great Sauvignon Blancs from classic Napa Valley producers."
563,Sélection de Grains Nobles Gewürztraminer,Hugel,1997,4.4,169.99,Alsace,France,Gewürztraminer,,,,,"Alsace is a wine growing region in Northeast France that borders Germany. Because Alsace is proximal to Germany, cradled in the shadow of the Vosges Mountain range and just east of the Rhine River, it shares many common grape varieties.

Gewürztraminer can trace its lineage to Alsace, and is the second most planted variety in the region.

Gewürztraminer is an aromatic grape, this is typically expressed as exotic fruits such as lychee, star fruit, passion fruit or mango. In addition to lush fruit notes, a host of other aromatics makes for a complex and heady elixir—orange peel, roses, honey, and baking spices are also common fragrances. A deep gold color, it tends to be full-bodied with fairly low acidity and sometimes has a lovely spritz (or slight effervescence).

As a rule, Alsatian Gewürztraminer is unoaked, and is produced in both a dry and off-dry style. Late Harvest Gewürz are made as well, generally labeled as Vendange Tardive (VT) and Sélection de Grains Nobles (or SGN meaning that the wines have been affected by Noble Rot).

Universally known as the wine to pair with spicy Asian cuisine, Gewürztraminer has a broader range of pairing potential. Both dry and off-dry Gewürztraminer will compliment roast duck, washed-rind cheeses like Epoisses, cream of potato soup, bratwurst, omelets with smoked salmon and pizza with figs and Praga ham. Pair off-dry Gewürztraminer with foie gras, apple tartin, or desserts featuring tropical fruit."

Fiano and Greco are the two big white varietals in Campania and Basilicata, while Sicily has become known for their Bianco d'Alcamo, a dry wine made from the Marsala grape.

Southern Italy's reputation has taken a beating in recent years as they have become known for producing bulk wine that they can't sell, and the reputation seems to endure despite some lovely wine coming from Sicily, Campania and Basilicata.

Fiano tends to be a wonderfully creamy white wine with lots of green apple skin and pear. Greco, arguably Campania's flagship white grape, is a lot crisper, and typically has an abundance of minerality, lemon notes and pear.

The white wine of Southern Italy pairs extremely well with the creamy regional cuisine, as well as with some freshly caught fish or shellfish."

Grown and produced in Northeast France, the volcanic and limestone soils provide the perfect canvas for a wine of superlatives and class.

One should do what they must to ensure that life is not spent without having experienced the complexity and sumptuousness of Alsatian Pinot Gris.

Historically Alsace has been in a tug-of war between France and Germany, but France won. What this means for the wine is that production methods and nuances of both countries make their way into the bottles this region produces.

The wines are full-bodied, with a flavorful bouquet of lime, meyer lemon, green apple, pear, and white peach. They exemplify the notions of ripeness, spice, and high acidity. Expect Alsatian Pinot Gris to be a little spendier than other varieties of this grape.

Be sure to serve this wine ice cold. This wine pairs very well with light fishes such as perch, and soul. It also tastes amazingly well with chicken, turkey, duck or pork. Cruciferous vegetables are well complimented by the acid in the wine as are well spiced greens."

Gewürztraminer can trace its lineage to Alsace, and is the second most planted variety in the region.

Gewürztraminer is an aromatic grape, this is typically expressed as exotic fruits such as lychee, star fruit, passion fruit or mango. In addition to lush fruit notes, a host of other aromatics makes for a complex and heady elixir—orange peel, roses, honey, and baking spices are also common fragrances. A deep gold color, it tends to be full-bodied with fairly low acidity and sometimes has a lovely spritz (or slight effervescence).

As a rule, Alsatian Gewürztraminer is unoaked, and is produced in both a dry and off-dry style. Late Harvest Gewürz are made as well, generally labeled as Vendange Tardive (VT) and Sélection de Grains Nobles (or SGN meaning that the wines have been affected by Noble Rot).

Universally known as the wine to pair with spicy Asian cuisine, Gewürztraminer has a broader range of pairing potential. Both dry and off-dry Gewürztraminer will compliment roast duck, washed-rind cheeses like Epoisses, cream of potato soup, bratwurst, omelets with smoked salmon and pizza with figs and Praga ham.

This wine tends to have mellower tannins than its French counterpart.

Heavily dependent on where they are grown for variations in flavor, Argentinian Malbec has quickly become a world favorite due to the characteristics that the high altitude climate and soils impart to the fruit.

Originally from France, it is one of the original 5 “Bordeaux” grapes. It is scarcely planted in France anymore.

It has found an amazingly hospitable home in the mountains of Argentina from which some of the world's best selling Malbecs are grown.

Starkly different from French versions in structure and flavor, this wine is a good investment for collectors, as the wine can age for several years before drinking.This wine also pairs very well with any savory red meat dish-- particularly dishes that include spice."

Spätlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.

Beaujolais produces light, dry red wines made from Gamay. Perhaps what the region is best known for is Beaujolais Nouveau, a fresh and fruity red wine made for immediate consumption.

Beaujolais is described as a refreshing red with low tannins and bright acidity. Juicy strawberry and raspberry fruit aromas are the hallmark of these wines. The more serious Beaujolais Crus sport mineral and earthy notes, as well as tart cranberry and violet overtones.

Some 35 million bottles of Beaujolais Nouveau are packed and shipped worldwide, within two months of harvest, hitting US shores around Thanksgiving! Roughly one-third of Beaujolais' production is dedicated to producing wines in the quaffable Nouveau style.

The remaining production is typically labeled as Beaujolais-Villages and there are 10 distinctive Crus, which are from distinct vineyard sites. Beaujolais Crus, unlike Nouveau wines, are darker in color, richer and fuller in body and can withstand some aging.

Nouveau is a classic wine at the Thanksgiving table—it loves roasted turkey and cranberry sauce, and it will also pair amiably with smoked salmon or trout, pork chops, quiche and charcuterie."

There is a lot of scope for versatility with this sweet, viscous wine, though you can expect to get hints of tropical fruit, nectarine, melon and pineapple from a solid Riesling.

The grape originated in the Rhine region of Germany, and the best of them are said to grow along the banks of the Mosel River on the beautiful steep, south facing hills.

There are six categories of Riesling which indicate the ripeness of the grapes. Kabinett is considered “off-dry” and is a typically ripe grape. Spätlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.

It's a favorite in the food and beverage industry because of its willingness to play with a wide variety of foods, particular spicy dishes. The current Asian fusion boom is thought to have had a tremendous effect on Riesling's popularity."

768,Arbois Vin Jaune,Domaine Jacques Puffeney,2007,4.2,99.87,Arbois,France,Savagnin,,,,,"Vin jaune from the Jura region of France, is best known for oxidized nutty and toasty flavors and aromas, similar to a dry Fino Sherry. These high-acid wines also offer up notes of curry, spice, citrus and mineral.

To create vin jaune, wine from Savagnin grapes—an ancient variety native to northeastern France and southwestern Germany—spends six years nearly untouched under a layer of flor (naturally occurring yeast) inside a cask (a process similar to sherry production, but Vin Jaune is not fortified).

Vin jaune is made in four Jura appellations: Arbois, Château-Chalon, Côtes du Jura and L'Étoile. The best examples of vin jaune come from Château-Chalon, where the Savagnin is late-harvested so it achieves more flavor and ripeness. It is also the only wine that's allowed to be made in that region.

True to its name, 'vin jaune', which translates to 'yellow wine', can show in the glass as bright yellow or golden in color."

Because Alsace is proximal to Germany, cradled in the shadow of the Vosges Mountain range and just east of the Rhine River, it shares many common grape varieties.

Gewürztraminer can trace its lineage to Alsace, and is the second most planted variety in the region.

Gewürztraminer is an aromatic grape, this is typically expressed as exotic fruits such as lychee, star fruit, passion fruit or mango. In addition to lush fruit notes, a host of other aromatics makes for a complex and heady elixir—orange peel, roses, honey, and baking spices are also common fragrances. A deep gold color, it tends to be full-bodied with fairly low acidity and sometimes has a lovely spritz (or slight effervescence).

As a rule, Alsatian Gewürztraminer is unoaked, and is produced in both a dry and off-dry style. Late Harvest Gewürz are made as well, generally labeled as Vendange Tardive (VT) and Sélection de Grains Nobles (or SGN meaning that the wines have been affected by Noble Rot).

Universally known as the wine to pair with spicy Asian cuisine, Gewürztraminer has a broader range of pairing potential. Both dry and off-dry Gewürztraminer will compliment roast duck, washed-rind cheeses like Epoisses, cream of potato soup, bratwurst, omelets with smoked salmon and pizza with figs and Praga ham. Pair off-dry Gewürztraminer with foie gras, apple tartin, or desserts featuring tropical fruit."

Fiano and Greco are the two big white varietals in Campania and Basilicata, while Sicily has become known for their Bianco d'Alcamo, a dry wine made from the Marsala grape.

Southern Italy's reputation has taken a beating in recent years as they have become known for producing bulk wine that they can't sell, and the reputation seems to endure despite some lovely wine coming from Sicily, Campania and Basilicata.

Fiano tends to be a wonderfully creamy white wine with lots of green apple skin and pear. Greco, arguably Campania's flagship white grape, is a lot crisper, and typically has an abundance of minerality, lemon notes and pear.

The white wine of Southern Italy pairs extremely well with the creamy regional cuisine, as well as with some freshly caught fish or shellfish."

Beaujolais produces light, dry red wines made from Gamay. Perhaps what the region is best known for is Beaujolais Nouveau, a fresh and fruity red wine made for immediate consumption.

Beaujolais is described as a refreshing red with low tannins and bright acidity. Juicy strawberry and raspberry fruit aromas are the hallmark of these wines. The more serious Beaujolais Crus sport mineral and earthy notes, as well as tart cranberry and violet overtones.

Some 35 million bottles of Beaujolais Nouveau are packed and shipped worldwide, within two months of harvest, hitting US shores around Thanksgiving! Roughly one-third of Beaujolais' production is dedicated to producing wines in the quaffable Nouveau style.

The remaining production is typically labeled as Beaujolais-Villages and there are 10 distinctive Crus, which are from distinct vineyard sites. Beaujolais Crus, unlike Nouveau wines, are darker in color, richer and fuller in body and can withstand some aging.

Nouveau is a classic wine at the Thanksgiving table—it loves roasted turkey and cranberry sauce, and it will also pair amiably with smoked salmon or trout, pork chops, quiche and charcuterie."

Cabernet, Merlot, Mourvedre, Grenache, and Syrah are some of the most important red grapes in the region.

Most wine producers in this region produce blends, as opposed to single varietal wines. There are some outstanding values to be found in wines from this region. Many red blends from this area retail for well under $20!

Languedoc-Roussillon is the biggest wine producing region in the world, responsible for over 1/3 of France's wine production.

Although the region has been known to produce cheap table wine in the past, many vineyards and cooperatives are replacing lesser quality vines with higher quality wine varieties and production methods. The quality has been steadily improving since the 1970s when the region was best known for churning out cheap jug wine.

The two regions of Languedoc-Roussillon produce distinct styles of red wine, although they are lumped together.The Languedoc is known for fruit-forward and full-bodied wines that can also be quite complex. Roussillon produces riper and juicier blends, as well as late-harvest and fortified wines."

Very similar to Sauvignon Blanc, in many respects, Grüner Veltliner is a great alternative to explore, expressing nuances that will make your nose and palate crave more. Although hard to find, sparkling Grüner are exceptionally fun to try.

Dry, delicate, with a tingly finish, this wine imparts significant citrus flavors of lime, lemon, and grapefruit. Some Grüner also have a prevailing nectarine note as well. For non-fruits Grüner, you can expect white pepper, and slight bitterness of flavors of vegetables like radish.

If oaked, which not all are, you will taste and smell nut and cream. These wines do not have significant shelf life, and are best enjoyed within 2 years of bottling.

When pairing with food think light delicate proteins such as veal, paté, or roasted pork. This wine goes also well with light flaky fish, and mollusks such as oysters and mussels. Grüner goes particularly well with soft cows' milk or goat cheese, and is traditionally paired with Wienerschnitzel."

As a rule, Alsatian Gewürztraminer is unoaked, and is produced in both a dry and off-dry style. Late Harvest Gewürz are made as well, generally labeled as Vendange Tardive (VT) and Sélection de Grains Nobles (or SGN meaning that the wines have been affected by Noble Rot).

Universally known as the wine to pair with spicy Asian cuisine, Gewürztraminer has a broader range of pairing potential. Both dry and off-dry Gewürztraminer will compliment roast duck, washed-rind cheeses like Epoisses, cream of potato soup, bratwurst, omelets with smoked salmon and pizza with figs and Praga ham. Pair off-dry Gewürztraminer with foie gras, apple tartin, or desserts featuring tropical fruit."

Widely planted, though once derided, Riesling is the superstar of the white wine world at the moment.

There is a lot of scope for versatility with this sweet, viscous wine, though you can expect to get hints of tropical fruit, nectarine, melon and pineapple from a solid Riesling.

The grape originated in the Rhine region of Germany, and the best of them are said to grow along the banks of the Mosel River on the beautiful steep, south facing hills.

There are six categories of Riesling which indicate the ripeness of the grapes. Kabinett is considered “off-dry” and is a typically ripe grape. Spätlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.

It's a favorite in the food and beverage industry because of its willingness to play with a wide variety of foods, particular spicy dishes. The current Asian fusion boom is thought to have had a tremendous effect on Riesling's popularity."

These high-acid wines also offer up notes of curry, spice, citrus and mineral.

To create vin jaune, wine from Savagnin grapes—an ancient variety native to northeastern France and southwestern Germany—spends six years nearly untouched under a layer of flor (naturally occurring yeast) inside a cask (a process similar to sherry production, but Vin Jaune is not fortified).

Vin jaune is made in four Jura appellations: Arbois, Château-Chalon, Côtes du Jura and L'Étoile. The best examples of vin jaune come from Château-Chalon, where the Savagnin is late-harvested so it achieves more flavor and ripeness. It is also the only wine that's allowed to be made in that region.

True to its name, 'vin jaune', which translates to 'yellow wine', can show in the glass as bright yellow or golden in color."

The best sweet styles are made from grapes affected by noble rot, which become golden and honeyed. Dry styles possess a chalky minerality to them.

Spanning the Loire River as it flows out to the Atlantic Ocean, the region has diverse soils and climates, meaning Chenin Blanc comes in all different styles.

Because of the grape's inherent high acidity, Chenin Blanc's charm can be lost in cooler vintages, with the acid overpowering."

The region also produces off-dry versions generally labeled as Vendange Tardive (VT or late harvest) and Sélection de Grains Nobles (SGN meaning that the wines have been affected by Noble Rot).

Alsace is a wine growing region in Northeast France that borders Germany. Because Alsace is proximal to Germany, cradled in the shadow of the Vosges Mountain range and just east of the Rhine River, it shares many common grape varieties.

Riesling is the darling of Alsace, and a favorite of wine lovers worldwide, for it is both versatile and budget friendly.

Alsatian Rieslings are terroir-expressive and said to have a fresh and vibrant profile, often with an appealing minerality shining through. This is due, in part to the dry, sunny climate and the soil types found in the region—a mix of granite, limestone, schist and sandstone are typical.

The true beauty of Alsatian Riesling, both the dry and off-dry version, is that they are extraordinarily food friendly. Try dry Rieslings with fish tacos, sushi, smoked fish, asparagus and, one of our favorites, goat cheese. Off-dry Rieslings have an affinity with Thai food, curries, shrimp cocktail and, another one of our favorites, apple pie."

917,Arbois Vin Jaune,Domaine Jacques Puffeney,2006,4.2,141.0,Arbois,France,Savagnin,,,,,"Vin jaune from the Jura region of France, is best known for oxidized nutty and toasty flavors and aromas, similar to a dry Fino Sherry. These high-acid wines also offer up notes of curry, spice, citrus and mineral.

To create vin jaune, wine from Savagnin grapes—an ancient variety native to northeastern France and southwestern Germany—spends six years nearly untouched under a layer of flor (naturally occurring yeast) inside a cask (a process similar to sherry production, but Vin Jaune is not fortified).

Vin jaune is made in four Jura appellations: Arbois, Château-Chalon, Côtes du Jura and L'Étoile. The best examples of vin jaune come from Château-Chalon, where the Savagnin is late-harvested so it achieves more flavor and ripeness. It is also the only wine that's allowed to be made in that region.

True to its name, 'vin jaune', which translates to 'yellow wine', can show in the glass as bright yellow or golden in color."

923,Sauvignon Blanc Late Harvest,Honig,2016,4.5,58.52,Rutherford,United States,Sauvignon Blanc,4.1800003,3.9,2.99,,"California is known primarily for its Cabernet and Chardonnay, but they are also producing some really lovely Sauvignon Blancs. These wines are typically high in acidity and great with food.

Sauvignon Blanc in California is usually a little fruitier than it is in France, and a little lighter in body and color than a typical Chardonnay.

Sauvignon Blanc might be the perfect wine for summertime and California makes some of the best. The wines are usually light, crisp, and brimming with gorgeous flavors of zesty lime, grapefruit, and melon. These fruit flavors are perfectly complemented with subtle herbal flavors. Some say that Sauvignon Blanc smells like freshly mown grass.

One of the best parts about Sauvignon Blanc is that it is relatively inexpensive. A lack of new oak and smaller demand, keeps its prices lower than Chardonnay. You can get great deals on these. Look for great Sauvignon Blancs from classic Napa Valley producers."

Because Alsace is proximal to Germany, cradled in the shadow of the Vosges Mountain range and just east of the Rhine River, it shares many common grape varieties.

Gewürztraminer can trace its lineage to Alsace, and is the second most planted variety in the region.

Gewürztraminer is an aromatic grape, this is typically expressed as exotic fruits such as lychee, star fruit, passion fruit or mango. In addition to lush fruit notes, a host of other aromatics makes for a complex and heady elixir—orange peel, roses, honey, and baking spices are also common fragrances. A deep gold color, it tends to be full-bodied with fairly low acidity and sometimes has a lovely spritz (or slight effervescence).

As a rule, Alsatian Gewürztraminer is unoaked, and is produced in both a dry and off-dry style. Late Harvest Gewürz are made as well, generally labeled as Vendange Tardive (VT) and Sélection de Grains Nobles (or SGN meaning that the wines have been affected by Noble Rot).

Universally known as the wine to pair with spicy Asian cuisine, Gewürztraminer has a broader range of pairing potential. Both dry and off-dry Gewürztraminer will compliment roast duck, washed-rind cheeses like Epoisses, cream of potato soup, bratwurst, omelets with smoked salmon and pizza with figs and Praga ham. Pair off-dry Gewürztraminer with foie gras, apple tartin, or desserts featuring tropical fruit."

There is a lot of scope for versatility with this sweet, viscous wine, though you can expect to get hints of tropical fruit, nectarine, melon and pineapple from a solid Riesling.

The grape originated in the Rhine region of Germany, and the best of them are said to grow along the banks of the Mosel River on the beautiful steep, south facing hills.

There are six categories of Riesling which indicate the ripeness of the grapes. Kabinett is considered “off-dry” and is a typically ripe grape. Spätlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.

It's a favorite in the food and beverage industry because of its willingness to play with a wide variety of foods, particular spicy dishes. The current Asian fusion boom is thought to have had a tremendous effect on Riesling's popularity."

Beaujolais produces light, dry red wines made from Gamay. Perhaps what the region is best known for is Beaujolais Nouveau, a fresh and fruity red wine made for immediate consumption.

Beaujolais is described as a refreshing red with low tannins and bright acidity. Juicy strawberry and raspberry fruit aromas are the hallmark of these wines. The more serious Beaujolais Crus sport mineral and earthy notes, as well as tart cranberry and violet overtones.

Some 35 million bottles of Beaujolais Nouveau are packed and shipped worldwide, within two months of harvest, hitting US shores around Thanksgiving! Roughly one-third of Beaujolais' production is dedicated to producing wines in the quaffable Nouveau style.

The remaining production is typically labeled as Beaujolais-Villages and there are 10 distinctive Crus, which are from distinct vineyard sites. Beaujolais Crus, unlike Nouveau wines, are darker in color, richer and fuller in body and can withstand some aging.

Nouveau is a classic wine at the Thanksgiving table—it loves roasted turkey and cranberry sauce, and it will also pair amiably with smoked salmon or trout, pork chops, quiche and charcuterie."

The region also produces off-dry versions generally labeled as Vendange Tardive (VT or late harvest) and Sélection de Grains Nobles (SGN meaning that the wines have been affected by Noble Rot).

Alsace is a wine growing region in Northeast France that borders Germany. Because Alsace is proximal to Germany, cradled in the shadow of the Vosges Mountain range and just east of the Rhine River, it shares many common grape varieties.

Riesling is the darling of Alsace, and a favorite of wine lovers worldwide, for it is both versatile and budget friendly.

Alsatian Rieslings are terroir-expressive and said to have a fresh and vibrant profile, often with an appealing minerality shining through. This is due, in part to the dry, sunny climate and the soil types found in the region—a mix of granite, limestone, schist and sandstone are typical.

The true beauty of Alsatian Riesling, both the dry and off-dry version, is that they are extraordinarily food friendly. Try dry Rieslings with fish tacos, sushi, smoked fish, asparagus and, one of our favorites, goat cheese. Off-dry Rieslings have an affinity with Thai food, curries, shrimp cocktail and, another one of our favorites, apple pie."
